This is the data science course at Ariel university, the professors name is
Dr Roi Yozevitch. This project contains four note books.
1. Improving our classification notebook from the first semester project.
2. Fashion Mnist project
3. Cats vs Dogs project
4. Hand movement project
In the second semester we learnt more about data science and how to improve
our results, we learnt Ensemble learning and Random forest, Dimensionality Reduction
and unsupervised learning techniques.
I hope my project will be good and I will learn from it as much as I can.
