<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Data Science Final Project September 2021.

This is the data science course at Ariel university, the professors name is
Dr Roi Yozevitch. This project contains four note books.

In this project I will be using the tools we have learnt during the second semester to try and solve all the notebooks with the highest accuracy as possible.
We learnt Ensemble learning and Random forest, Dimensionality Reduction and unsupervised learning techniques.


---------

### First part: Improving

Within this part I had to go back to my classification project from the first semester and check if I can improve my results using the new tools I have learnt
The main tools I used to improve my project is Ensemble learning.

---------

### Second part: Fashion Mnist

In this section we our tasked with the knows fashion mnist dataset, it is a dataset filled of pictured of different fashion items.
Out goal is to be able to classify as well as possible.

---------

### Third part:

In this section we will look at the Cats vs Dogs dataset, which is another data set made of pictures.

---------

### Fourth part:

In this last section we are tasked in classifying between hand movement position, Spontanious, Syncharnised and Alone.

----------


<!-- Improving classification-->

###  Improving classification

Last semester, I used the movie dataset as my classification project.

In hindsight, at the end of the project I understood that I picked a bad dataset for Classification.

However, I managed to improve my project using Ensemble learning methods.


---------

<!-- Fashion Mnist -->

### Fashion Mnist

Who doesn't like clothes?

In this section, we had to classify between different types of clothes.

I used the Xgboost classifier model and my result is 88%


---------

<!-- Cats vs Dogs -->

### Cats vs Dogs

In this section, we have the Cats vs Dogs dataset, this set was more challenging, we had to upload the pictures into a dataFrame.

Our model needs to be able to classify between cats and dogs.

I used the Bagging classifier and I got 65% accuracy.

---------

<!-- Hand movement -->

### Hand movement

In this section, we have Hand movement dataset, this was by far the most challenging notebook.

We had to turn all the data that we have into a big DF, and merge a few timestamps together.

My best model was Stacking and I got 90% accuracy.
